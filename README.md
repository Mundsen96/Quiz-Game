This is an App, which takes the custom made API call for random questions and answers. The customization is made by a form, which creates an API
address. The Questions are then rendered and the user can answer them. After the Check Answers button is clicked, the score is shown and the user
is able to see the mistakes he's made and also able to play the game again. Each time with different questions.
